# Vintage Story Mod - Universal Husbandry
## Description
Adds the ability to domesticate most vanilla animals (with the exception of bears)

## How it works
The json patches add the [Multiply behaviour](https://github.com/anegostudios/vsessentialsmod/blob/e9dbc197df1a329b5b8789e2aa086b525ff4d3c8/Entity/Behavior/BehaviorMultiply.cs) to most animals that didn't have it already. Also adds meats to troughs so certain animals can be domesticated.

## Bugs and Problems
If you find any bug just submit an issue with a good description of the bug, and how to replicate it.
